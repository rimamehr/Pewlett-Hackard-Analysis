# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Pewlett Hackard has a lot of employees getting ready to age out of the program. This is going to create a considerable amount of openings.
As part of our analysis we have been tasked to future-proof the company by determining how many people will be retiring and, of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package.
We will need to dive into the data and perform queries to learn when employees were hired as well as their age. It has been determined that anyone born between 1952 and 1955 will begin to retire so using SQL we created separate list of employees for each department.
